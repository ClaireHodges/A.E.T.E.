	<p> A.E.T.E. Is a student-run club. </p>
	<p> But before you join, meet its fabulous members!</p>
	<h2> Ellie and Maria </h2>
	<p> As we're 2 new 7th Grade students, we're always free for a laugh and a chat. The 80 started as a random idea between us. We are new friends who wanted more english in the school!!! </p>
